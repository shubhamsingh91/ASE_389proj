# ASE389_proj
This is the class project for ASE389 Decision and Control of Human-Centered Robots.

1. Trajectory for Walking Robotics (TOWR) (https://github.com/ethz-adrl/towr) library is modified to include some constraints on the robot for navigating indoor environments.
2. TOWR uses trajectory optimizer IPOPT for solving the non-linear programming problem and runs using ROS.
3. Two kinds of problems are solved in this project:
    a. Obstacle avoidance using a quadruped:
